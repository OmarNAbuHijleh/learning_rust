    /*
        The display trait
        In the real world, a contract is a document people sign that state their obligations. It's a similar idea to traits in Rust.

        In Rust, a trait is like a contract that requires a type support one or more methods. 
        They establish consistency between different types. When a type honors those requirements, it "implements" the trait. The types themselves can still vary in implemenatation logic

        A type doesn't have to implement a trait. It is up to the developer what traits are implemented for what types. This is basically interfaces in other programming languages

        NOTE: The benefit if a trait is that they are handled during compile time instead of run time, reducing the number of dynamic lookups that take place!

        ABOUT THE DISPLAY TRAIT: The display trait requires that a type can be represented as a user-friendly, readable string. 
        When we use the {} interpolation syntax, Rust calls on the format method for that type.

        Integers, floats, and booleans all implement the display trait so that we're able to interpolate them with curly braces.

        It's not always clear how a complex type should be represented as a piece of text. An example would be an array type. Rust didn't implement the display trait for the array
